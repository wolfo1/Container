REMARKS:

ANSWERS:
Question 1: 
The general use of Linux pid namespaces is to allow containers to provide functionality such as resuming/suspending the 
set of processes in the container and migrating the container to a new host while the processes maintainthe same PIDs.

Question 2:
Creating a separate mount namespace allows all of the proccesses to have a completely seperate view of the mountpoint structure 
from the original one. This allows having a different root for each process, as well as other mountpoints that are specific to those proccesses.

Question 3:
The general use of Linux Cgroups is to define what the container can do, for example limiting the maximul number of proccesses to 100.

Question 4:
Fork() is the original system call for UNIX, you can only create proccesses with fork.
Clone() is the "newer version" of system calls which can create proccesses but also can create threads.

Question 5:
If we would like to change the root directory in Linux then we use the Chroot command.
As said in class everything is Linux is a file, and it also has a root directory.
This command changes the root directory for currently running proccesses and also changes 
the root directory of it's childs proccesses. 

Question 6:
The procfs is a special file system that presents information about proccesses, 
which provides and more convenient method for accessing process data which is inside the kernel memory.
We can also think of it as a way of communication between user space and kernel space.
An example of use is the GNU version of the process reporting utility ps uses the proc file system to obtain its data,
 without using any specialized system calls.
